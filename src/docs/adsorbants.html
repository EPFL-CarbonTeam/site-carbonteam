                    At the Carbon Team, adsorbents play a crucial role and are a topic of ongoing research in our
                    partner laboratories. Combined with temperature swing adsorption (TSA), they can separate and
                    capture gasses, in our case CO2.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    Adsorbents are materials designed to attract and hold gases on their surface. Think of adsorbents as
                    special sponges designed to trap CO₂. Just like sponges have pores to hold water, adsorbents have
                    tiny pores that capture CO₂ molecules. But there's a twist: adsobants doesn't just hold the CO₂
                    forever, they can release it when needed, making them reusable for multiple cycles.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    The TSA process can be broken up into two main stages:
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-bold text-white">1) The Adsorption Phase:</span> During this phase, the adsorbent
                    captures CO₂ from a gas stream. The
                    adsorbent material is kept at a room temperature, which makes it easier for CO₂ molecules to stick
                    to its surface.
                    </br>
                    <span class="font-bold text-white">2) Desorption Phase:</span> Once the adsorbent has reached and
                    equilbrium loading of CO₂, the system heats
                    it up. The higher temperature affects this equlibrium, letting go of CO₂ molecules, freeing the
                    adsorbent for reuse. The released CO₂ can then be collected and stored or used for other purposes.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    New adsorbants are being disovered and perfected every day to optimize key componenets. This quest
                    is a case of finding a balance between key paramters. The ideal adsorbant should of course have a
                    great adsoption capacity and high selectivity (targenting only CO2 molecules). However, its thermal
                    stability, moisture tolerance and cost of regeneration are just as important factors.
                    Three adsorbants have already made their proofs:

                <p class="mt-4">
                    • Zeolites are crystalline, porous materials with precise pore sizes that selectively trap CO₂
                    molecules, making them ideal for high-concentration CO₂ capture in industrial settings.
                    <br>
                    • Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are highly tunable materials with massive internal surface areas,
                    offering exceptional CO₂ capture capacity and selectivity, especially in advanced technologies.
                    </br>
                    • Activated Carbon is a versatile, porous material derived from organic sources, known for its high
                    surface area and ability to work effectively in humid and diverse temperature conditions

                <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">
                    Adsorbents are our vital tools at the carbon team for tackling climate change. By selectively
                    capturing CO₂ through adsorption and using thermal energy to release it, these systems offer a smart
                    and sustainable way to manage carbon emissions.
