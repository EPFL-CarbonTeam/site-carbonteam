                    Imagine a pasta strainer, but on an atomic scale -its nanometer-sized holes allow CO₂ molecules to
                    pass through while blocking others, offering incredible precision and efficiency. These membranes
                    are highly selective, permeable for fast filtration, and sustainable due to their low energy
                    demands.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Creating these membranes with such extraordinary precision is no small task (no pun intended).
                    Scientists use ozone (O₃) to etch pores into graphene sheets, creating holes so fine they can
                    control the movement of specific gas molecules. The O₃ molecules react with the carbon atoms to form
                    perfectly sized nanopores.

                    Despite their potential, challenges remain. Scaling up production while maintaining consistent
                    quality is a hurdle. Current fabrication processes, though groundbreaking, are complex. Furthermore,
                    graphene membranes face degradation issues when exposed to humidity, which limits their efficiency
                    in real-world applications.
                    <br>
                    However, researchers are exploring innovative methods to address these barriers through new
                    production procceses. Additionally, combining graphene with other materials can improve its
                    resilience against mxoisture, further broadening its applicability.

                    The benefits of graphene membranes extend beyond CO₂ capture. They could transform industries
                    reliant on gas separation, such as hydrogen production, natural gas refinement, and even water
                    desalination. The ability to separate gases (or liquids) with unmatched precision could reduce
                    greenhouse gas emissions and advance clean energy technologies.

                    Graphene membranes stand at the forefront of sustainable innovation, offering a glimpse into a
                    cleaner, more efficient future. While challenges in production and durability remain, ongoing
                    research continues to unlock their vast potential. At the Carbon Team, they have a pivotal role in
